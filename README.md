The goal of this project is to build and design a language model that can successfully distinguish funny text segments from humorless ones. You will never have to worry about misinterpreting a joke again. (Just to be clear, this is a binary classification task.)

This project should expose you to the field of natural language processing (NLP) if you haven't seen it already as well as help you develop concrete skills in designing, implementing, and fine-tuning a classifier in this domain.
